q2:

I disagree with Ahmed's opinion. The git add command is important because it helps us identify changes that affect other files.
It gives us better control over files and makes it easier to save and organize them. If we're working on multiple changes and there are more than one person holding the code, without git add, we can't specify which files to commit, making it easier to work with the team.
In short, it specifies which files should be in the next file.

The -u command in git push -u origin main binds the current connection to the file after it has been linked.
You can use git push and git pull without having to sign the remote machine name or branch in the future, because Git knows exactly where to bind
